<p> â€‹For this piece I built a giant sword that belongs to a man name Trunks from the anime series Dragon Ball Z. The cultural significance in this piece is that it ties to the Japanese anime culture in which I love and enjoy. This sword has a lot of meaning  because this sword originally belonged to someone else name Tapion who was the original owner. He later passed down his sword to a younger version of trunks as a token of their friendship. From that point on, after  Tapion disappeared, Trunks  kept the sword with him for the rest of his life in remembrance of his friend. </P>
