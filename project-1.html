<img src="Dio.jpg" alt="Darkness">

<p> On this piece of art stands a man name Dio that is glitched out using the program Audacity. With the static effect and darkness, this truly represents the character as in the anime series, he remains hidden most of the time in darkness planning his next attack on his opponents. </p>

<img src="glitch kujo.jpg" alt="Light">

<p> This this art is a man name Jotaro Kujo, which represents the light in the darkness. For this, I used the text editor to brighten and blur the image. This is our main hero in an anime series Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure. The light and blurriness really captures his character because all though sometimes things may seem blurry and hard at first, he somehow finds a way to conquer his enemies. </P>
